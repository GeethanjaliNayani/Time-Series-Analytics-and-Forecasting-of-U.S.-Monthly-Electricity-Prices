# Time-Series-Analytics-and-Forecasting-of-U.S.-Monthly-Electricity-Prices

Developed and benchmarked multiple time-series forecasting models to predict U.S. monthly electricity prices, incorporating macroeconomic drivers (CPI, natural gas imports) and seasonal factors. Compared deterministic, exponential smoothing, regression, and ARIMA-based approaches, achieving robust forecasts with ~2% error on hold-out data. Delivered insights into long-term pricing trends, cyclical behavior, and inflationary impacts, supporting data-driven decision-making in the energy sector.

**Key Features**:
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and structured 27 years of monthly electricity data; engineered lagged variables, seasonal indicators, and polynomial trends.
2. Exploratory Analysis: Performed decomposition, autocorrelation, and periodogram analysis to detect trends, cycles, and seasonality.
3. Model Development: Built and compared deterministic (piecewise trend + seasonality), exponential smoothing, regression with external regressors (CPI, NGAS), and ARIMA/ARIMAX models.
4. Residual Diagnostics: Conducted ACF/PACF analysis on residuals, applied ARIMA corrections, and validated model assumptions.
5. Performance Evaluation: Benchmarked models using MAPE, RMSE, and MAE; best model achieved ~2% forecast error on hold-out data.
